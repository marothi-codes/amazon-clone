# Full-Stack Amazon clone featuring Google Firebase

This is a full-stack demo object with a React.js frontend with Google Firebase providing backend functionality. The application has payment processing, a fully functional shopping cart and also has user authentication but it is a cloud first web application most of all. I've had tons of fun with this one and I sure hope it fully demonstrates my REACT prowess.
